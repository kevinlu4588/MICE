## Evaluation Results

### Simple Van Gogh Evaluation
**Test Setup:**
- **Prompt**: "a painting by Vincent van Gogh"
- **Test Cases**: 5 comparison pairs
- **Seeds**: 5000-5004 (reproducible)
- **Architecture**: Matching SD1.4 for both original and erased models

### Visual Results Analysis
The comparison grid shows **significant improvements** over previous models:

1. **Enhanced Erasure Effect**: More pronounced differences between original and erased outputs
2. **Style Modification**: Erased model produces noticeably different artistic styles
3. **Maintained Quality**: Image quality preserved while concept is modified
4. **Consistent Results**: Reliable erasure across all 5 test cases

### Key Observations
- **Test 1**: Original shows classic Van Gogh swirls, erased shows portrait style
- **Test 2**: Original maintains Van Gogh landscape style, erased shifts to different artistic approach  
- **Test 3**: Original preserves characteristic brushwork, erased adopts alternative style
- **Test 4-5**: Consistent pattern of style modification while maintaining artistic quality
